# node-demo

I recorded a video on how to setup a project with modern Node.js, and I realized it would be helpful to share officially by way of YouTube as well!

ESM and JSDoc type checking is a really nice place to start for writing solid code, be it the browser or Node.js. This video is for Node.js in particular. The parts around the `tsconfig.json` apply to anything JavaScript-related though.

It makes it very simple to move to full on TypeScript down the line as well, because it's only a matter of renaming your file extensions to `.ts`, then using IDE refactoring to "Annotate everything with types from JSDoc". I think converting untyped projects to TypeScript is really easy with this method too, because you don't have to change the build step in order to get type checking working.
